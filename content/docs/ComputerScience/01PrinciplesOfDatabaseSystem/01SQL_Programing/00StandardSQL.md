### SQL Classification

The main SQL is classified into:

- DDL(Data Definition Language)
    - CREAT
    - ALTER
    - DROP
- DML(Data Manipulation Language)
    - SELECT
    - INSERT
    - UPDATE
    - DELETE
- DCL(Data Control Language)
    - GRANT
    - REVOKE

We haven't listed all of them yet---some are standard-compliant, and the others are 'non-standard SQL extentions', for example: function\procedure\package and so on.
